```

Visit http://localhost:1337/admin in your browser to login.
![Strapi Admin Login](https://res.cloudinary.com/craigsims808/image/upload/v1737184283/strapi/strapi-railway/strapi-admin-login_mxcmfn.png)

Create a new collection type name it `Global`. Add a single `text` field named `text`.

Click on `Content-Type Builder` > `Create new collection type` in the navigation.

![Create Global Collection](https://res.cloudinary.com/craigsims808/image/upload/v1737184659/strapi/strapi-railway/create-global-collection_iuejqp.png)

Add a new entry to the `Global` collection. Give it the value, "Hello Strapi".

Go to  `Content Manager` > `Collection types` - `Global` in the navigation.
Click on Create new entry.

![Add entry to global collection](https://res.cloudinary.com/craigsims808/image/upload/v1737249089/strapi/strapi-railway/global-collection-entry_g9aq2a.png)

Enable Public Read access to your `Global` collection API. Click on `Settings` > `Users & Permissions Plugin` > `Roles` > `Public` > `Permissions`.

![Enable Public Access to API](https://res.cloudinary.com/craigsims808/image/upload/v1737249835/strapi/strapi-railway/enable-public-access-to-api_uq2tek.png)

In your terminal test out the API by running the following command:
```shell
curl localhost:1337/api/globals
```

You should see the following JSON response:
```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "documentId": "cnuj5blzet9zbtyv3311rpjp",
            "text": "Hello Strapi",
            "createdAt": "2025-01-18T07:22:01.233Z",
            "updatedAt": "2025-01-18T07:22:01.233Z",
            "publishedAt": "2025-01-18T07:22:01.241Z"
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "pagination": {
            "page": 1,
            "pageSize": 25,
            "pageCount": 1,
            "total": 1
        }
    }
}
```

## Deploy to Railway using CLI

Railway offers many ways to deploy your web app. You can use the dashboard, the CLI, the API etc. This article: [Railway Deployment Options](https://docs.railway.com/quick-start) explains all the numerous ways you can deploy an app on the Railway platform.

In this step, we will use the Railway CLI. If you prefer using the dashboard skip to the next section.

Stop your Strapi server using `CTRL` + `C`. 

In your terminal, install the Railway CLI tool:
```shell
curl -fsSL https://railway.com/install.sh | sh
```

Login to your Railway account:
```shell
railway login --browserless
```

Create a new Railway project:
```shell
railway init
```

Link your Strapi project folder to your Railway project:
```shell
railway link
```

Deploy your Strapi app.
```shell
railway up --detach
```

The deployment will fail, as you will need to update your Railway project with the necessary environment variables. 
The following variables need to be added to your Strapi project in Railway: `HOST`, `PORT`, `APP_KEYS`, `API_TOKEN_SALT`, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET`, `TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT`, `DATABASE_CLIENT`, `DATABASE_FILENAME`, `DATABASE_SSL` and `JWT_SECRET`.

Copy the values from your `.env` file:
```
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=1337
APP_KEYS=/M/DMAN536wRHe+Vf9K2Cg==,uogMfTxg3jJvNfctla2xAw==,ne6731wcSzH2tQ6dgDiEYQ==,srycFvmx8KTrsq6N60C8DA==
API_TOKEN_SALT=XJtQnpUf8OEXL7b7LBWunQ==
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=+DSzXmSsQOsS0V6O0npL2g==
TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT=fceG+mK0nhBh7c8AbX1HAw==
DATABASE_CLIENT=sqlite
DATABASE_SSL=false
DATABASE_FILENAME=.tmp/data.db
JWT_SECRET=Ppx1F1bpyYnjumiGIJSk3g==
```

Select `Variables` in your Railway dashboard to update your project with the required environment variables.

![Add environment variables to Railway](https://res.cloudinary.com/craigsims808/image/upload/v1737253718/strapi/strapi-railway/add-railway-variables_ofw07w.png)

After updating the environment variables, redeploy your Strapi app.
```shell
railway up
```

When the Strapi app deployment is ready, generate a domain.
```shell
railway domain
```

### Test Strapi API hosted on Railway

Test out your Railway-hosted Strapi API in your terminal. Run the following command:

```shell
curl <your-railway-project-url>/api/globals
```

Replace `<your-railway-project-url>` with the URL generated by Railway. You should get the same response as you did when you tested the project locally.

In your browser visit `<your-railway-project-url>/admin` to login to your project.

## Deploy to Railway using GitHub

We will use the GitHub and the Railway dashboard for this option.

### Turn Strapi project into GitHub repo

Before you deploy the project to Railway, you must turn it into a GitHub repo.

Stop your Strapi server using `CTRL` + `C`. 

Initialize your project directory as a Git repo.
```shell
git init
```

Comment out or delete the text `.tmp` in your `.gitignore` file so that source control includes the SQLite database for your Strapi app.

Commit your project files.
```shell
git add .
```

```shell
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Authenticate with GitHub
```shell
gh auth login
```

Upload your repo to GitHub
```shell
gh repo create hello --public --source=. --remote=origin
```

```shell
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

Replace `hello` with your desired repo name.


### Create a new Railway project

Visit https://dev.new in your browser. This will redirect you to https://railway.com/new and you will see a **New Project** modal with deployment options.

![Railway New Project Modal](https://res.cloudinary.com/craigsims808/image/upload/v1735561144/freelance/falcon-feather/railway-create-new-project-dashboard_x3f2le.png)

Select **Deploy from GitHub repo** and choose the repo you created previously.

![Deploy From GitHub repo](https://res.cloudinary.com/craigsims808/image/upload/v1737251920/strapi/strapi-railway/deploy-from-github-repo_v33pmh.png)

The Railway platform will read the contents of your repo, initialize the project, build and then deploy it automatically as a service. The deployment will fail as a few settings need to be done in your Railway project.

![Railway Build unsuccessful](https://res.cloudinary.com/craigsims808/image/upload/v1737253268/strapi/strapi-railway/railway-fail_pok9lh.png)
